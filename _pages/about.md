I am an Experimentalist in particle physicist. I am developing the hardwares, software packages.
I am a memeber of E34 

# Interests
I am doing analysis the particle physics data and developing the tools for that. 
I want to develop the useful tools for people based on my skills.
Also I am a teach for young, talented students.

# Research Experiences
my google scholar : [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0vN_HG0AAAAJ&hl=ko,"Google Scholar link")

# Projects
## Software
### Monte Carlo simulation
I am developing simulation with Monte carlo algorithm. I generated Big data to study the systematic error in my experiement.
I am using Geant4 simualtion tools which is c++ package for particle physicist.
### Track Fitter
This is fitting program with kalman filter algorithm. I fitted the distorted helix track.
I am using GenFit package which is useful tools for c++ package. It is done. 
### Trak Finder
This is track finding packager with Machine Learing algorithm in a long term plane. It is working with low efficiency. - Still ongoing.
## Hardware
### DC to DC converter
This is power electic circuit to supply the constant DC power based on Buck converter. It is done.
