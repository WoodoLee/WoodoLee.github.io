I am an Experimentalist in particle physicist. I am developing the hardwares, software packages.
I am a memeber of E34 

# Interests
I am doing analysis the particle physics data and developing the tools for that. 
I want to develop the useful tools for people based on my skills.
Also I am a teach for young, talented students.

# Research Experiences
my google scholar : [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0vN_HG0AAAAJ&hl=ko,"Google Scholar link")

<span style="color:green">Beam Test</span>

I did beam test in Triumf@UBC, Canada.
Our group got real muon data for testing material(aerogel) target to generate muonium.
[Muonium emission paper](https://academic.oup.com/ptep/article/2014/9/091C01/1530603, "Muoniumlink")

<span style="color:Blue">Magnet Test</span>

I did DC to DC converter test in KEK, J-PARC, Japan.   
I comfirmed the stability operation of my DC to DC converter in High B field test. 
Paper work is ongoing.

# Projects
## Software
### Monte Carlo simulation
I am developing simulation with Monte carlo algorithm. I generated Big data to study the systematic error in my experiement.
I am using Geant4 simualtion tools which is c++ package for particle physicist.
### Track Fitter
This is fitting program with kalman filter algorithm. I fitted the distorted helix track.
I am using GenFit package which is useful tools for c++ package. It is done. 
### Trak Finder
This is track finding packager with Machine Learing algorithm in a long term plane. It is working with low efficiency. - Still ongoing.
## Hardware
### DC to DC converter
This is power electic circuit to supply the constant DC power based on Buck converter. It is done.
