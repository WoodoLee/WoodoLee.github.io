# Experiences

I have so many interested in analysis the Big physics data - 10 to the 12 order. Because the experiment needs extereme low statistical error(0.1 ppm), we have nothing choice but to analysis such a big data. I joined to Software group since 2018. My first Job is making finaly missing piece - Track fitter. I made it and implemented to whole software package. </br>
Also I am trying to improve track finder with Deep learning algorithm. Actually, there are some tries ex. Boost Dicision Trees. But the efficieny is quite low and the simulation time it too long. Critically, It is supervised learning which I should know the answer to adopt that method. We don't know the answer in the real experiment. </br>
So I am trying to make the track finder with Non-supervisor method. There are several attempt to do that in CERN - GNN, RNN.. But it is hard to adpot thier method because the situation is very different. I am struggling to study that and adopt to our group.</br>
