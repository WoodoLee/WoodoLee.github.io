# Experiences

My All experiences are concentrated on Finding muon g-2/EDM value. I am trying to get the systematic error for our experiment. I joined the group since 2012 with my first job - DC to DC converter. I do my research with my collobrator usually - It's a common charateristic for Particle Physicsists, especially for Experimentalist. I spent most my time in Japan, KEK and J-PARC. There are various kind of people from various Countries. This condition helps me a lot. Now I expected getting physics ph.D for next year. Without my collaborators, I cannot do it, definetely.
